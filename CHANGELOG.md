## [Unreleased]

Fixes from the second GPT-5.5 Pro re-review (issues #22–#27). Every item was re-verified against the
code before it was worked: some of what the review asked for was already there, and two of its claims
were wrong in a way that changed the fix.

### Fixed
- **A hung media provider could hang "Delete everything" and "Restore" for ever.** The 10-second read
  timeout was around `openInputStream` and `InputStream.read`, both blocking binder calls with no
  suspension point, so it could not fire until the read had already returned — the timeout was dead
  code. The blocked worker held one of the copier's two permits and stayed registered in
  `VaultMaintenance.workers`, which an exclusive run joins *before* it takes the pipeline lock. The
  read now runs in the copier's own scope and is awaited with a timeout, so the copy gives up on time
  and the thread is abandoned rather than joined.
- **A media URI whose provider had gone away was reported as "media too large".** A dead provider
  returns a null stream instead of throwing, and that fell into the same branch as the over-size
  early return. It is an expired link, and says so.
- **Notification bitmaps ignored the 512 MB media quota**, which was checked only on the `content://`
  path. The check now sits where both paths meet. Quota exhaustion also has its own state and label:
  calling a 4 KB thumbnail "media too large" because the vault was full was never true.
- **A message whose media copy threw showed an hourglass for ever.** The row stayed `PENDING`, and
  `MessageDao.pendingMedia` — the query written for exactly this — had no caller anywhere. One
  failing copy also cancelled every sibling in its batch, leaving those `PENDING` too. Copies are now
  independent of one another, a failure is recorded as one, and the retention sweep settles anything
  still pending after an hour.
- **Media files whose row never committed were permanent dead weight.** Reclamation compared rows to
  rows and never the directory to the database, so a file written before a process death (or an
  interrupted restore) was never seen again. The sweep now removes files no row points at, skipping
  anything younger than an hour so it cannot race a copy that has not committed yet.
- **Media copies were queued without a bound.** Only bitmaps were counted, so any number of URI-only
  copies could pile up behind the copier's two permits, each one a job an exclusive run has to join.
- Opening the source app swallowed a failed launch: if the app had been disabled or removed since the
  button was drawn, nothing happened and nothing was said. It now says so.
- The same dialog claimed "the original notification is no longer active" every single time, because
  the flag behind it was hardcoded. QuietInbox never keeps a source `PendingIntent`, so it cannot know
  whether the notification is live — the sentence now says what is actually true: the app opens at its
  own starting screen, not at this chat.
- **Between 600dp and 839dp the conversation had no visible way back.** One value decided both where
  the navigation sits and whether the inbox stays beside the conversation, but those have different
  breakpoints: the rail replaces the bottom bar at medium width, while `ListDetailSceneStrategy`'s
  default directive gives two panes only from expanded width. On a small tablet, a landscape phone or
  a split-window pane the conversation therefore filled the window while the code believed the inbox
  was still next to it, and drew no back arrow. The system back gesture still worked and the rail
  still led out, so nobody was trapped — but the only visible exit was gone. The two decisions are
  now separate, and so are they in `tools/demo-screenshots.sh`, which had inherited the same
  assumption.
- The recovery key said it was "the only way to open your backups on another device" without ever
  saying what losing it costs. It is the only way to open them *anywhere*: "Delete everything"
  destroys the key too, so every backup already taken becomes unreadable on this device as well. The
  screen says that now, and warns about screenshots when the screenshot block — whose toggle is on
  that same screen — is off.
- TalkBack could not tell that a message was selected, that a conversation was unviewed, or copy a
  message at all: selection and the unviewed dot were signalled by colour alone, and copying existed
  only as a touch-drag inside `SelectionContainer`. The message row now carries its selection state,
  the inbox row its unviewed state, and each message a Copy and a Delete accessibility action. There
  is a Copy button in the selection toolbar too, which is where a sighted user was missing it.
- In a group chat TalkBack read the sender's name as a node of its own, so the merged message node
  never said who sent it. The row is one node now.
- An avatar monogram cut a surrogate pair in half, so a name beginning with an emoji ("😀 Mom") drew a
  lone half-character as tofu. Two call sites, not one.
- The Traditional Chinese activity tab was labelled 神隱率 — slang for "went dark on you" — which is
  precisely the claim `ActivityAnalytics` and that catalogue's own header forbid. It is 安靜天數 now,
  in step with the Japanese and Korean labels. The word also reached the live Play store description.

### Changed
- ADR-0005 said the recovery key "is shown once". It is re-showable on demand, and has been all
  along — a key seen once and mistranscribed is only discovered on the day a restore is attempted.
  The ADR now describes what ships, in both languages.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` no longer opens with a comment line: `sha256sum -c` reports one as "improperly
  formatted". Which of its four files the release actually carries is said in the release notes now,
  with the `--ignore-missing` invocation that verifies them. `v0.1.3`'s copy still has the comment.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-09-07

`versionCode` 7. Three user-visible string defects that the store screenshots had baked in, and the
screenshot harness that let a whole tablet set of the wrong screens reach Google Play.

### Fixed
- The inbox summary counted in the plural regardless of the count: with one uncertain observation the
  English inbox read "plus **1 observations** with uncertain identity", and one saved message would have
  read "1 recognisable **messages** saved". It is now two `plurals` resources in all five catalogues, and
  the sentence about uncertain identity is left out entirely when there is none of it rather than saying
  "plus 0 observations".
- The capture-health page glued a sentence to a fragment: "Connected does not guarantee the source posts
  a notification for every message. **since** 11:18 PM" in English, and the same with a stray space in
  Chinese. Each language now has one sentence with the timestamp in it.
- **Ten of the fourteen tablet store screenshots were not QuietInbox.** `docs/screenshots/tablet/` and the
  `tenInchScreenshots` uploaded to Google Play for en-US and zh-TW held the launcher home screen and the
  system Settings app instead of the app: only `1_inbox` and `2_conversation` were genuine, and the zh-TW
  `3_search` was an English system screen filed as a Traditional Chinese asset. `tools/demo-screenshots.sh`
  looked for the navigation items in the bottom bar only, a tablet puts them in a left rail, so every tab
  tap missed, the run walked out to the launcher, and the 80 KB floor passed 3.3 MB of wallpaper. Both
  locales are re-shot from the demo vault and inspected one by one.
- `tools/demo-screenshots.sh` handles both layouts: it reads the window width in dp, taps the navigation
  rail when the window is ≥ 600dp wide and the bottom bar otherwise, treats the conversation as ready on a
  wide window when the pinned title is on screen twice (list row and detail header) instead of waiting for
  a bottom bar that never appears, and does not press BACK on a layout where the rail never left.
- **Every screenshot is now gated on QuietInbox being the app on screen** (`app-foreground`: at least one
  node of `dev.quietinbox.app.debug` in the UI dump), and a navigation tap that finds no target fails the
  run instead of warning and carrying on. Those two guards are what the earlier tablet set was missing.
- Round-27 review fixes (`docs/reviews/2026-09-06-round27/`): the round-26 "bound both edges of the rail
  candidate" fix was a tautology — `box[2] <= K` already implies `box[0] <= K` — so where several nodes
  carry a tab's label the one furthest into the navigation strip now wins, lowest on a bottom bar and
  leftmost on a rail, instead of whichever Compose emitted first; the selected-item check only counts
  nodes belonging to the app and inside the strip, so a pulled-down notification shade or a selected
  filter chip cannot answer for a navigation item; the tap is re-sent on each confirmation attempt
  rather than sent once and merely re-checked; each of `tap_tab`'s failure paths says which one it was;
  and the inbox summary glued its gap clause on with an ASCII space in every language, which the
  Chinese and Japanese screenshots showed — it goes through the same locale-aware joiner now.
- Round-26 review fixes (`docs/reviews/2026-09-06-round26/`): a tab tap is confirmed rather than assumed —
  after tapping, the harness re-reads the screen and requires the tapped item to be the selected one, so a
  swallowed tap fails the run instead of capturing the previous page; the bottom-bar rule is gated on the
  narrow layout the way the rail rule is gated on the wide one; a failure
  to switch the device into night mode fails the run rather than producing a light `7_inbox_dark`; the UI
  dump retries, since every screenshot now depends on one; and `LAYOUT` is declared with the other globals.

### Changed
- The release workflow now carries the R8 mapping: `dist/` gets `quietinbox-<version>-mapping.txt` for
  `gplay deobfuscation upload` and the GitHub release gets the gzip of it, both covered by
  `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Play Vitals stack traces for 0.1.2 are obfuscated because the mapping for that
  build was never uploaded and cannot be reconstructed.
- Documentation fixes found by a full en/zh-Hant parity audit: `docs/SCOPE.md` (both languages) had four
  stale test counts (`CaptureCoordinatorTest` 16→32, `VaultMaintenanceTest` 4→5, `core:reconcile` 20→22,
  `core:analytics` 32→34), still listed release signing as not done, and still called the package id a
  placeholder; `docs/zh-Hant/ARCHITECTURE.md` was missing the activity-screen paragraph;
  `docs/zh-Hant/adr/0001` was missing the `:parsers:apps` addendum; `docs/zh-Hant/reviews/README.md` was
  missing the whole-repo round row; ADR-0006 and ADR-0007 had no link to their Chinese versions;
  `docs/RELEASE.md` gave the what's-new path without its `fastlane/` prefix; `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
  pointed at a non-existent ADR filename. `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` still
  told contributors to add strings to two catalogues when the parity gate requires five, and named only
  the storage instrumented suite when CI runs storage, crypto and backup. The README now shows the
  Traditional Chinese screenshots in its Chinese half and the English ones in its English half, and its
  English half has the module table instead of a pointer at the Chinese one.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-09-06

`versionCode` 6. Three more UI languages and the review rounds 13–23 fixes on top of 0.1.1. 0.1.1 was a GitHub-only release, so the store notes for `versionCode` 6 also carry the 0.1.1 audit fixes in one clause.

### Added
- Simplified Chinese (zh-Hans), Japanese (ja) and Korean (ko) localisations of every UI string and the listener label, an Android 13+ per-app language list (`locales_config.xml`), and Google Play listings, release notes and what's-new texts for zh-CN, ja-JP and ko-KR. `tools/check-strings.py` (run in CI) fails the build when any catalogue is missing a name, a placeholder or a plurals `other` item. The demo vault speaks the app's language too (`DemoLocalisation`: names, group titles and bodies in zh-Hans / ja / ko), so the store screenshots for the new languages read naturally. `localeFilters` also keeps the AndroidX `zh-rCN` / `zh-rTW` / `zh-rHK` resources, so the material3 date and time pickers and content descriptions are Chinese for Chinese users (they were English in 0.1.0 and 0.1.1).

### Fixed
- Dates and times follow the app language. Every screen formatted them with the process default locale, which an Android 13+ per-app language does not update while the process is alive (the notification listener keeps it alive), so a user who switched QuietInbox to Japanese or Korean saw Japanese strings with English dates and AM/PM times until the process restarted; the UI now formats with the composition's locale (`currentLocale()`), covered by `TimeFormatTest` (round 21).
- Round-21/22 review fixes (`docs/reviews/2026-09-06-round21/`, `round22/`): the screenshot tool sets and confirms the app language before anything starts the process and stops the process again before the launch, refuses the inbox, conversation, activity and capture shots of a non-English run when an AM/PM time or an English month is on screen (the app's own nodes only; it assumes an English device language), waits until the pinned title is on screen *and* the bottom bar is gone before the conversation shot and fails the run otherwise, fails on a lingering input method, retries the query check; `TimeFormat` requires its locale at compile time; all five locales re-shot.
- Round-13 review fixes (mini re-review of the post-round-12 commits, `docs/reviews/2026-09-06-round13/`): a cold-start loss or lock-out gap the vault could not settle at the first attempt (locked again, a reset cancelling the write) is kept in memory and written on the next policy load / next Ready instead of being forgotten; a `COLD_START` gap row that lands after the policy already loaded is closed at once rather than at the next policy load; a notification from an enabled source held across a disconnect, pause or maintenance run records a bounded `COLD_START` gap of its own (its arrival predates the gap those events open); backup export bounds its media pages to the highest blob id read inside the row transaction, so a picture committed after the snapshot is never exported without its message; the reviews index no longer says the manifest media count was fixed (it was documented).
- Round-14 review fixes (`docs/reviews/2026-09-06-round14/`): the overflow and stale-held gap writes keep the loss when the write fails (the same retry as a lock-out loss), so the ADR's "only forgotten once written" holds for every cold-start loss; the policy load re-checks for a cold-start row that landed between its settle and the flag flip and closes it (volatile write-then-read on both sides); a stale-held notification records no gap when its source is paused or when the reconnect's resync holds the same notification again; `MediaDao.maxId` / bounded `exportPage` get an instrumented test (`MediaExportBoundTest`); the bitmap-bound test asserts the bound, not the launch order of the copies.
- Round-15 review fixes (`docs/reviews/2026-09-06-round15/`): the stale-held suppression added in round 14 is keyed by the posts actually queued in the same release (framework key *and* post time, read only for capturable sources), and the whole batch is classified against one reading of the generation and the pause, so a disconnect or pause landing mid-release can neither let a notification suppress itself nor hide a replaced post; `sbnOf` is the one notification mock in the coordinator tests.
- Round-16 review fixes (`docs/reviews/2026-09-06-round16/`): a held notification that a disconnect or pause overtakes mid-release records its gap (each item is decided at its own moment; the suppression set is built only from posts actually queued — `enqueue` now reports a full queue — so nothing can be suppressed by itself); the cold-start test verifies that an app the user never enabled has only its package name read; SCOPE names the resync exception.
- Round-19 review fixes (`docs/reviews/2026-09-06-round19/`): the store-screenshot tool switches every input method off while it types the search query and asserts the query before the shot — on Android 13+ the keyboard follows the app language, and the kana / hangul / pinyin layouts had turned "meeting" into gibberish, so the zh-TW (shipped with 0.1.0), zh-CN, ja-JP and ko-KR search screenshots showed no results; all five locales are re-shot without a keyboard in frame. Korean and Traditional Chinese leftovers (소스 앱, 來源 App / 執行期間 / QuietInbox 的提醒), the Japanese store texts (活動, サイレント モード), realistic demo utility bills, `values-tv` / `values-car` no longer taken for locales and flagged placeholders (`%.1f`) checked by the parity gate; `monogram()` has a JVM test.
- Round-20 review fixes (`docs/reviews/2026-09-06-round20/`): the screenshot tool waits for the pinned conversation's title before the conversation shot (the zh-CN one had been the loading screen), refuses any shot under 80 KB, types the search query one key at a time after the input method has settled and dismisses it with ENTER (keys injected too early arrived out of order), reports a failed UI dump separately from a wrong query, and registers its cleanup trap after the helpers it calls, waits until the per-app locale request has stuck before launching the app and names the demo's language on the seed broadcast (`--es lang`, `DemoData.seed(now, locale)`); `__pycache__` is ignored; the five locales were re-shot and inspected one by one.
- `CaptureCoordinatorTest` +8 (32), `MonogramTest` (4), `TimeFormatTest` (2); 212 JVM tests in total; instrumented storage 16.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-06

`versionCode` 5. Issue-driven pass over the 2026-09-06 GPT-5.5 Pro audit (issues #1–#17; base `96b0cf9`). Database schema is now v3 (`MIGRATION_2_3`: three nullable columns, no row rewritten).

### Security and privacy (audit P0)
- #1 Capture policy is now atomic with the pipeline. Every event is fenced twice — before waiting for the pipeline lock and again inside it — and once more right before the commit; a pause, a maintenance run, a revoked listener or a source switched off while the event waited wins. Enabling, disabling, pausing and removing a source go through `CaptureCoordinator` and update the in-memory policy under the pipeline lock; disabling or removing a source discards its pending journal rows (`DISCARDED`, payload cleared). Journal replay is held while capture is paused, runs on resume, and discards rows whose source was disabled since instead of replaying them.
- #2 Media copies are off until the disclosure is accepted. `mediaCopyEnabled` now defaults to off and is only effective together with `mediaDisclosureAccepted`; the copier re-reads the setting when it starts. **Behaviour change for existing installs:** an installation that had the old default (on) but never saw the disclosure now reads as off until the switch is turned on and the disclosure accepted in Settings.
- #3 "Delete all data" is a verified, exclusive maintenance run (`VaultMaintenance`): capture is fenced, media copies / journal replay / retention are cancelled and joined, the pipeline lock is held throughout, database files, media files and every key are deleted and *checked*, and the result names the step that failed instead of reporting done. `BlobCipher` ties its cached primitive to a key epoch that a reset bumps, so nothing is ever encrypted with a destroyed media key. The maintenance window is recorded as an exact capture gap (`MAINTENANCE`).
- #4 Notification text no longer outlives its commit: a journal row's payload is cleared the moment it leaves `PENDING`. Deleting messages or a conversation removes their media rows in the same transaction and the files right after it; removing a source with its data also removes its suppression tokens, summaries, diagnostics and pending journal; the conversation projection (counts, preview, last sender, last activity) is rebuilt from what remains after every deletion, expiry and restore. The retention worker no longer waits for "battery not low".
- #5 Keystore KEK creation is serialised process-wide: three secrets created at once on a fresh install can no longer mint two keys under the same alias.

### Data correctness (audit P1)
- #7 Expired copies are hidden at read time (conversation, search, statistics, counts) instead of only after the retention worker ran; retention rebuilds the projection of the conversations it swept.
- #6 (partial) Media blob row and message link are written in one transaction; a copy that fails or is cancelled after its file was written removes the file; a thumbnail that failed to encrypt is simply absent; a queued bitmap stays counted until the copier is done with it; retention treats a blob its message no longer points at as an orphan.

### Data correctness and product behaviour (audit P1/P2, wave 2)
- #13 Nothing is read from a third-party notification before the source policy is known: the framework object is held in a bounded buffer (256), the policy is loaded right away (waiting for the vault), then only notifications from enabled sources are snapshotted and queued; the rest are dropped unread. If the vault does not open within 15 s the buffer is dropped and the window recorded as a bounded `COLD_START` gap — fail closed. The onboarding resync goes through the same buffer.
- #9 Window alignment is id-aware: two items align by source id when both carry one and by fingerprint otherwise, so a never-seen id at an overlapping position is a new message while content stored before a parser learned ids still aligns with its id-bearing repost. Deletion suppression now suppresses when both sides carry the same source id, otherwise by post time: a replay of the same or an older post is suppressed, a later post with the same text is stored. Residual limitations: an app that re-posts the same id-less content with a new post time after a reboot comes back; and because a token is keyed by fingerprint, a genuinely new message with the same fingerprint inside the same post as a deleted one is suppressed too.
- #11 Search pulls candidates in keyset pages and keeps verifying until the page is full or the index is exhausted, so false-positive candidates can neither under-fill a page nor hide a later true hit; `SearchRepository.searchPage` returns a cursor. Analytics take the median interval within conversations only and rank senders by source + conversation + stable key (else name), so two people with the same name are two rows; the report carries the interval sample size.
- #10 Search and conversation pages show "Vault locked" with a retry instead of "no results" / a blank page, and keep loading while the vault opens; a query typed while opening runs once it is ready.
- #15 The daily reminder is posted only when at least one conversation of the chosen sources (or of all sources) has copies newer than the last time it was opened; the text carries the count; the next run is scheduled before the worker returns; the notification permission is checked in the same method as the call.
- #14 The listener no longer declares `disabled_filter_types="ongoing"` (the parsers already treat ongoing notifications as system notices; the system-level exclusion was the only place that behaved differently per API level). Opening the notification-access screen tries the listener detail page, the listener list and the app-info page in turn and shows the manual path when none exists on the device.
- #16 Backup runs under the maintenance gate: export is cancellable vault work, import an exclusive run. Export streams every table in keyset pages inside one read transaction (never a whole table in memory) and never contains an expired copy; media that could not be read is counted and reported ("N media items could not be read and are not in this backup"); restore rebuilds the conversation projection with the shared `rebuildProjection`.
- #8 The inbox tags conversations from a work (or secondary) profile; `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` documents work profiles, Device Policy, low-RAM devices and how to submit an anonymised fixture (#17). Per-profile source control and a non-null account key are recorded as deferred schema work.
- #12 Lint errors now fail the build (`abortOnError = true`, the one existing error fixed); the Gradle wrapper pins the distribution SHA-256; issue forms (bug, source compatibility, feature), a pull-request template, `CODEOWNERS` and Dependabot for GitHub Actions were added. The About section links the real repository.
- Round-11 review fixes: a cold-start buffer that overflowed, or that still held items when the policy loaded through another path, now releases them with a bounded `COLD_START` gap instead of losing them silently (buffer 256, one open gap per lock-out, closed when the policy loads; held items keep their arrival time); a journal insert that throws is recorded as an exact gap plus a `JOURNAL_FAILED` diagnostic instead of being "marked retryable" on a row that never existed; export decrypts media *outside* the read transaction so a large media set never blocks live capture writes, and an export refused during a reset says so; two differing source ids no longer clear a candidate on their own (the token remembers only the last of several same-fingerprint deletions), post time decides then; the notification-access screens are simply tried in order without a `resolveActivity` pre-check; reminders count only conversations that still have visible copies; the unexpected-error reset path shows a localised message; `BackupRoundTripTest` exercises the gate (an export during an exclusive run is refused); dead `reminder_body` string removed.
- After round 12 (verified by tests only, re-reviewed in round 13): held notifications are released *before* the source-policy flag flips, so a notification arriving during the release cannot overtake the ones held before it (CI on Linux caught the reordering); the in-flight bitmap-bound test keeps every copy in flight until released.
- Round-12 review fixes: a loss the *locked* vault could not record at the time — a cold-start drop, or the pipeline's own lock-out — is remembered and written as a bounded gap as soon as the vault can be written again (before, the gap row failed silently behind the same lock); the cold-start gap starts at the first eviction, not at a survivor; an open cold-start row is closed by reason once the policy loads (idempotent, so a restore cannot leave it open); the cold-start job re-checks the buffer before ending; backup export reads media one keyset page at a time outside the transaction (no whole-table list in memory) and its KDoc says what the transaction still covers; the unused single-intent settings wrappers were removed; the two module-level lint errors that `abortOnError` had exposed outside `:app` are fixed (`relativeTime` reads the locale through the composition; the synthetic publisher checks the notification permission next to `notify()`), so `./gradlew lint` passes for every module.
- Round-10 review fixes: replay excludes paused sources at the query so their rows cannot occupy the whole page; a `BlobCipher` build that raced a reset is retried once under the new epoch and then fails closed, never returning a primitive of a destroyed key; maintenance start/end reach the capture side through explicit listener callbacks instead of a conflating `StateFlow`; a reset that fails part-way still reopens the vault (`finally { retry() }`) and its end-of-run bookkeeping never blocks the caller; `MediaCopier` clears its cleanup list inside the transaction; conversation previews are cut at 200 code points on both the live and the rebuild path; the reset failure snackbar names the step in the UI language.

### Added
- `VaultMaintenanceTest` (5 JVM tests: + a listener sees start and end exactly once even for an instant run): work runs and returns; work is refused while an exclusive run is active; an exclusive run cancels and joins work in flight; exclusive runs and pipeline-lock holders are serialised.
- `CaptureCoordinatorTest` +13 (24): a source disabled while an event waits for the lock is never journaled; a pause between acceptance and commit leaves the event pending; replay is held while paused and runs on resume; replay discards a pending row whose source was disabled; a maintenance run drops the queue, records an exact gap and starts a fresh generation; every maintenance run records its own gap, even two in a row; before the source list is known a notification is held unread and only sources are snapshotted; when the vault does not open, held notifications are dropped unread and a bounded gap is recorded; bitmaps in flight at the copier still count against the queue bound; a held buffer that overflowed records the drop and keeps only sources; a journal insert that throws is recorded as a gap; a cold-start loss and a pipeline lock-out that the locked vault could not record are written as bounded gaps once it opens.
- `VaultRepositoryTest` (3): a surviving database or media file is the failed step, keys are kept and the vault is reopened; the happy path destroys keys and clears settings. `SuppressionRuleTest` (4). `ReconcilerIdAlignmentTest` (2). `ActivityAnalyticsTest` +2 (within-conversation median; same-named senders ranked separately). `SearchViewModelTest` (2) and `ConversationViewModelTest` (1) for the locked / opening vault. `ReminderSchedulerTest` +1 (`ReminderPolicy`). 198 JVM tests in total.
- Instrumented `SearchPagingTest` (2: 250 false-positive candidates hide nothing and pages stay full with a resumable cursor; a deletion token suppresses a replay of the same post but not a later post) and `BackupRoundTripTest` (2: export holds only visible copies, reports skipped media, restore rebuilds the projection and brings the media file back under the current key; an export during an exclusive maintenance run is refused; CI's emulator lane now runs `:platform:backup`).
- Instrumented `DeletionGraphTest` (5): journal payload cleared on leaving PENDING; deleting the newest message rebuilds the projection; expired copies hidden before retention and projection rebuilt after it; removing a source with data leaves nothing behind (rows, files, tokens, summaries, diagnostics, pending journal); delete-everything is verified and no cached cipher outlives the old key. Instrumented `KeystoreWrapperTest` (parallel first use of a shared alias). `MigrationTest` +1 (v2 → v3).
- `AnalyticsViewModelTest` (8 JVM tests over mocked repositories): the first report is computed off the collector's thread; a period switch shows a clean placeholder without the previous period's "capped" label; a vault change recomputes without a loading state; a locked vault is shown as locked and recovers once unlocked (also when it locks while the page is open and the counts never change); an opening vault keeps loading until ready; a failing count query does not leave the page loading; a failing query marks the report as degraded.

### Changed
- Round 7 review: the activity page's loading placeholder no longer carries the previous period's report or "capped" honesty label; a locked vault is shown as "Vault locked" on the activity page instead of an endless spinner, and an opening vault keeps loading until it is ready; a failing vault-count query emits a fallback tick and retries with back-off instead of silently ending the recompute ticks; every query in the analytics computation propagates cancellation through one helper; cancellation is checked between the CPU stages so a period switch during a notification burst is not starved; the period chips reflect a tap at once even while a slow query is still being cancelled.
- Round 8 review: the vault state is now the outer signal of the analytics pipeline (`flatMapLatest`), so unlocking the vault recovers the activity page even when the message counts did not change; the ViewModel test harness mirrors the storage layer (counts are observable only while the vault is ready) and no longer depends on coroutine worker thread names; a query that fails during a computation now marks the report "may be incomplete" (honesty label) instead of silently showing a smaller report; the count-query back-off restarts after a minute without failures (a flapping query keeps backing off).

### Known issues in 0.1.1 (fixed in 0.1.2)
- The material3 date and time pickers and AndroidX content descriptions were English for Chinese users: `localeFilters` kept only the app's own `b+zh+Hant` catalogue and dropped the AndroidX `zh-rTW` / `zh-rCN` / `zh-rHK` resources (also in 0.1.0).
- Dates and times did not follow an Android 13+ per-app language while the process stayed alive (the notification listener keeps it alive): a user who switched QuietInbox to Traditional Chinese on an English system saw Chinese strings with English dates and AM/PM times until the process restarted (also in 0.1.0).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-06

First installable vertical slice (plan §3 "v0.1").

- Demo mode (debug builds only): `DemoDataRepository` fills the vault with fully synthetic, bilingual conversations — including one `AMBIGUOUS_REPEAT` pair, a revised message, a placeholder image, a preview-restricted body, capture gaps and diagnostics — so the app can be demonstrated and screenshotted without exposing a real notification. Triggered from Settings → Developer or from a debug-only broadcast receiver; `seed()` is idempotent and `clear()` deletes strictly by the `demo.quietinbox.` and `demo-` tags. Adds `tools/demo-screenshots.sh` (installs, walks onboarding, seeds, captures seven screens per locale) and the instrumented `DemoDataTest`. No schema change and no new permission.
- Activity statistics extended to five free tabs over one shared period selector (7 days / this month / last month / 3 months / all / custom range): a weekday x hour heat map, overall / weekday / weekend rankings, the dominant time band per conversation, observed messages per active day, the share of days with nothing observed plus the longest quiet run, repeated-phrase (CJK n-gram and Latin word) ranking per sender, and the emoji ranking re-scored per period. Nothing is locked behind a purchase and every label still describes observed messages only.
- Onboarding: scope, source selection, notification-access grant with restricted-settings guidance, synthetic test notification, label preview.
- Capture pipeline: `NotificationListenerService` → bounded allow-listed snapshot → bounded queue → encrypted journal → parser → identity → reconcile → single-transaction commit → media copy.
- Parsers: standard parser (MessagingStyle, InboxStyle, BigText, group summaries, preview placeholders, system notices) and five synthetic-only adapters (LINE, WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, Messenger).
- Identity and dedup: scoped identity keys, window alignment, `AMBIGUOUS_REPEAT`, revisions, stale-window replay handling, deletion suppression.
- Encrypted vault: Room + SQLCipher, per-installation Keystore-wrapped keys, retention worker, CJK/Latin n-gram search index.
- UI (Material 3 Expressive, zh-Hant + en): inbox with filters and quality labels, conversation with source/capture times and floating toolbar, search, activity statistics, capture health with sources/gaps/diagnostics, settings (theme, app lock, screenshot protection, retention, media disclosure, reminders, recovery key, encrypted backup/restore, delete all).
- Backup: Tink streaming-AEAD container keyed from a recovery key; verified import with atomic merge.
- Tests: 157 JVM tests (72 in `core:*` including two 1,000-iteration property tests, 43 adapter tests, 24 backup, 11 capture, 4 reminder, 3 crypto); instrumented SQLCipher round-trip, schema migration and durable key-write tests; RFC 5869 vectors.
- CI: JVM tests, assemble, network-permission gate, emulator lanes (API 29/35).

### Fixed (pre-release review round 1, 2026-09-06)
- Vault open failure could hang callers forever; pause did not rotate the capture generation; deleting a conversation did not suppress replays; restored media was garbage-collected; restore collapsed legitimate duplicates; journal replay raced live capture; FK violations rolled back whole batches; window alignment drifted with mixed ids; stale replays shrank checkpoints; resync produced spurious "possible repeat" rows; app lock could be bypassed on cold start; 4+ letter Latin and single CJK searches returned nothing; key files were not fsync'd. Database schema is now v2 with an explicit migration.
- Round 2 review: an ambiguous single repeat no longer shrinks the checkpoint window (a following post could duplicate messages); the key-directory fsync now really runs (`Os.fsync`; the java.io attempt silently failed on Android) and its failure is reported; export stages the ciphertext in a private temp file before touching the chosen document; restore staging bounds total text; the checkpoint-loss guard keeps multiplicity; stale window ids are dropped from checkpoints; capture no longer swallows coroutine cancellation.

### Changed (pre-publication reviews, 2026-09-06)
- Licence changed from Apache-2.0 to GPL-3.0-or-later (LICENSE, NOTICE, README, in-app licence text).
- Round 3 review minors: the checkpoint-loss guard links the newest matching rows (not the oldest); restore text staging limit lowered from 64M to 16M chars; best-effort bookkeeping in capture uses `guarded {}` (failures swallowed, cancellation propagated); disconnected session id cleared synchronously.
- Whole-repository review: a deleted conversation can no longer come back as an empty row after a notification replay (the conversation row is created only when something is stored); restoring a backup older than the retention window re-bases message expiry on the current setting instead of letting the next retention run delete everything; messages sent by the device owner are now recognised (`isSelf`) from MessagingStyle semantics; restore encrypts media before the write transaction and keeps duplicate multiplicity; restored sources come back disabled; `onRemoved` uses the same bounded tag as capture; SECURITY.md has a real reporting channel.
- Added `CLAUDE.md` (repository guidance for AI-assisted contributions).
- Rounds 5–6 review: the analytics "only the newest 50,000 messages are counted" notice is now rendered on every tab; a period switch shows a loading state at once while background vault changes recompute quietly, sampled at 400 ms after an immediate first pass, on `Dispatchers.Default`; restore no longer deletes attached blobs when a cancellation lands after the transaction committed; `isSelf` ignores blank names; the vault-count subscription is shared instead of duplicated and a failing vault-count query no longer leaves the page loading forever.
- Round 4 review (pre-publication): restore no longer leaves encrypted media files behind for messages it skipped, and reports only the media it actually attached; media preparation runs inside the cleanup scope; the summary-only count respects the end of the selected period; the demo seeder and its fictional content moved to the `debug` source set behind a `DemoData` interface (release binds a no-op); analytics load at most 50,000 messages per period (the UI says so when capped) and recompute at most once per 400 ms while the vault keeps changing (period switches recompute at once); custom periods are clamped like "All"; `isSelf` compares the MessagingStyle Person key/uri before falling back to the name; `MediaCopier` compresses a shared bitmap once and holds the permit for the whole unit of work; every GitHub Action is pinned to a commit SHA; `keystore.properties` gaps fail with a clear message; instrumented regression tests for the deleted-conversation replay and for `clear()` sparing non-demo rows.

### Known issues in 0.1.0 (fixed in 0.1.1)
- Activity page: while a new period is loading, the red "only the newest 50,000 messages are counted" label of the previous period stays visible (only on vaults with more than 50,000 messages in the previous period).
- Activity page: if the encrypted vault is locked (key unusable), the page shows an endless spinner instead of the "Vault locked" state; the inbox and capture-health pages do explain it.
