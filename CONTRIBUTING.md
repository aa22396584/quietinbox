# Contributing

Thanks for helping. A few rules keep this project honest and its users safe.

## Ground rules
- **No reverse-engineered assets.** Do not contribute rule lists, dictionaries, constants, decompiled
  code or fixtures taken from any other app or from research reports about them. Describe behaviour,
  write your own heuristics, and cover them with synthetic fixtures (`core:testing` DSL).
- **No real messages.** Fixtures and bug reports must be synthetic. If you need to share a real
  notification shape, replace every name, id, URI and body with placeholders first.
- **Evidence, not claims.** A PR that changes a parser must include fixture tests; a PR that claims a
  real-device result must include the device, OS build, source app version and the scenario id from
  `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`. "Compiles" is not "done".
- **Keep the invariants.** No `INTERNET`, no acting on source notifications, no cross-stream merging,
  no silent deletion of user data, no body text in logs or diagnostics.

## Workflow
1. Fork and branch from `main`.
2. `./gradlew test` — or the exact set CI runs:
   `./gradlew :core:model:test :core:parser:test :core:identity:test :core:reconcile:test :core:analytics:test :parsers:apps:test :platform:crypto:testDebugUnitTest :platform:storage:testDebugUnitTest :platform:backup:testDebugUnitTest :platform:capture:testDebugUnitTest :feature:analytics:testDebugUnitTest :feature:search:testDebugUnitTest :feature:conversation:testDebugUnitTest :app:testDebugUnitTest`
3. `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug && tools/check-permissions.sh app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
4. For storage, crypto or backup changes, on a device — the three suites CI runs:
   `ANDROID_SERIAL=<emulator> ./gradlew :platform:storage:connectedDebugAndroidTest :platform:crypto:connectedDebugAndroidTest :platform:backup:connectedDebugAndroidTest :feature:conversation:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
5. Open a PR with the checklist filled in. Crypto, schema and identity/dedup changes need a second
   reviewer and an ADR update.

## Style
- Kotlin official style, 120 columns, trailing commas.
- Every user-visible string in all five catalogues — `values` (en), `values-b+zh+Hant`, `values-b+zh+Hans`,
  `values-ja`, `values-ko` — with the same names, placeholders and plurals; `python3 tools/check-strings.py`
  (also a CI gate) must pass.
- Colour is never the only signal for a state; add text + icon.

## Maintainer
Provisional maintainer: the maintainer at <aa22396584@gmail.com> (security issues: see `SECURITY.md`).
The app ships as `dev.quietinbox.app` (Gradle namespace `dev.quietinbox`) and is published on Google Play,
so the package id is fixed; the name itself has not been through a trademark clearance.
