# Nothing here reads a real notification: every conversation in the shots comes from
# DemoDataRepository. Use an emulator — on a real phone the listener would copy the owner's own
# notifications into the debug vault. Both layouts are handled: on a window narrower than 600dp the
# navigation is the bottom bar, on a wider one it is the left rail and the inbox keeps the conversation
# beside it (list-detail). The size floor is calibrated on QuietInbox_Phone (1080×2400); a tablet shot
# is larger still. Every shot is refused unless QuietInbox itself is the foreground app — the guard
# that was missing when the first tablet set captured the launcher and the system settings instead.
